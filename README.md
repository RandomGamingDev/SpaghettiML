# SphagettiML
An ML algorithm implementation that uses a custom algorithm (might've been invented before I thought up of it idk cause I did this as a challenge to implement a neural network architecture idea I had while avoiding outside help like from searches) (Yeah, pretty sure it's a RNN) I call SphagettiML.

There's a basic example of how to use SphagettiML in Example.cpp.

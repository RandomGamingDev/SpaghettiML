# SphagettiML
An ML algorithm implementation that uses a custom algorithm (might've been invented before I thought up of it idk) I call SphagettiML.

The idea with this neural network is that instead of having layers, this neural network instead operates like a real human brain, with input, output and calculations being in a jumbled blob of neurons instead of distinct seperated layers. This should allow for better judgement, memory, less parameters and many other distinct advantages for this type of neural network. This neural network also uses a task based system based on a linked list and hashmap to save on memory, which is very important when dealing with larger neural networks and training multiple of them. You could also try combining this neural network with a genetic algorithm and other stuff if you'd like.

This library relies on https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/OneWayLinkedListLib for its linked list.
